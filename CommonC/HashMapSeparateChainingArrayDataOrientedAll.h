 * @header CCHashMapSeparateChainingArrayDataOrientedAll
 * CCHashMapSeparateChainingArrayDataOrientedAll is an interface for an array backed separately chained
 * hashmap implementation. How this differs from @b CCHashMapSeparateChainingArrayDataOrientedHash and
 * @b CCHashMapSeparateChainingArray is that hashes, keys, and values are all stored in separate arrays.
 * This allows for improved enumeration of keys or values, but a reduction in lookup and insertion compared
 * to the other separately chained array variants. Is better when there's a poor hash distribution or
 * a poor load factor, otherwise @b CCHashMapSeparateChainingArray is likely the better variation.
 *
 * Fast Operations:
 * - Lookup. (slower than other @b CCHashMapSeparateChainingArray* variants)
 * - Insertion. (slower than other @b CCHashMapSeparateChainingArray* variants)
 *
 * Moderate Operations:
 * - Enumerating of keys. (faster than other @b CCHashMapSeparateChainingArray* variants)
 * - Enumerating of values. (faster than other @b CCHashMapSeparateChainingArray* variants)
